I hold the secrets of the machine.
I hear the machine spirits voice.
It will only take me a moment.
I am honoured that you require my skills.
As you wish so shall it be done.
I am on it.
Of course.
I'll take care of it lord.
An easy matter for one of my skill.
The machine spirits are willing.
I shall hurry.
Machine spirit may our shots be true.
Into the fray attack.
Ah a challenge worthy of my skill.
Initiating construction.
I will ease the machines pain.
These repairs may require some time.
I am beseached!
I am under attack!
That shot almost got me!
Emperor protect me!
My will falters.
The field of battle awaits us again!
Repairs are completed and ready for duty sir.
This able beast should get us there.
Thank you machine spirit for our safe arrival.
